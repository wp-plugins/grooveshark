= Do I need to register a Grooveshark account? =

You only need to register a [Grooveshark](http://www.grooveshark.com "Grooveshark") account if you either want to add music from your favorite songs and your playlists on Grooveshark, or you want to add more than one song at a time (Having one link or one widget for multiple songs). The plugin will notify you if you choose these options, but didn't enter your username and password from Grooveshark.

= Why does the Grooveshark Widget disrupt the appearance of my blog posts? =

If you have Wordpress versions 2.2.x or 2.3.x, the HTML editor of these wordpress versions will strip <div> and <embed> tags from posts. When this is done after a widget is added to the post, stripping the HTML tags will cause the widget to disrupt the appearance of the page where the widget is shown.
To correctly display widgets, make sure the HTML editor does not strip tags. For this reason, it is encouraged that you use the Grooveshark Widgets and plugin only in Wordpress version 2.6.x and higher.
 If you experience this problems with wordpress version 2.5.x or later, send an email to the author. Please detail the problem and provide a link to the page in your email.
